Incline Bench Press is performed for 4 sets of 8-10 repetitions, targeting the upper chest. T-Bar Rows (4 sets of 10-12 reps) and Barbell Rows (underhand, 3 sets of 10-12 reps) provide comprehensive back development. Overhead Press is programmed for 3 sets of 10-12 repetitions to develop shoulder muscles. Upright Rows (4 sets of 12-15 reps) add additional shoulder and trap volume. Arm-specific hypertrophy work includes Barbell Curls (3 sets of 10-12 reps) and Skull Crushers (3 sets of 10-12 reps)."

Box Squats specifically target posterior chain development by providing a precise depth reference and encouraging maximal hip and hamstring engagement. Pin Squats allow lifters to develop strength in specific ranges of motion by starting the lift from a dead stop at predetermined positions, which can help overcome sticking points and improve overall movement efficiency."

Romanian Deadlift specifically isolates hamstrings, creating targeted posterior chain engagement. Good Morning exercise further targets posterior chain muscles and spinal erectors, promoting lower back strength and structural integrity. Barbell Hip Thrust and Barbell Glute Bridge are complementary movements that directly isolate and develop gluteal muscles, emphasizing hip extension and creating powerful, strong hip musculature."
