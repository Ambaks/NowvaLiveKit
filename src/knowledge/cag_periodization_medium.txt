## Focused Knowledge Base for Mesocycle Training Blocks

---

## DOCUMENT PURPOSE & SCOPE

This focused CAG document provides essential knowledge for programming **3-7 week barbell training mesocycles**. These medium-length programs are ideal for:
- Single training block/mesocycle
- Strength phases (accumulation, intensification)
- Hypertrophy blocks
- Skill development phases
- Pre-competition preparation blocks
- Fat loss phases with strength maintenance
- Specialized weak point training

**Equipment Required**: Olympic barbell, weight plates, squat rack, bench (adjustable)

**Target outcomes**: Measurable strength gains, hypertrophy, skill mastery, or performance improvement within a focused training block

---

## KEY PRINCIPLES FOR 3-7 WEEK PROGRAMS

### Adaptation Timeline
- **Week 1**: Neural adaptation begins, DOMS likely
- **Week 2-3**: Technique improves, performance increases
- **Week 4**: Potential for fatigue accumulation (consider deload if 6-7 week program)
- **Week 5-6**: Peak adaptations, strength/size gains realized
- **Week 7**: Transition week or deload before next block

### Volume Guidelines by Training Level
**Beginner (3-7 weeks):**
- Total weekly sets: 40-60
- Per muscle group: 8-12 sets/week
- Frequency: 2-3x per week full body
- Session duration: 45-60 minutes

**Intermediate (3-7 weeks):**
- Total weekly sets: 60-100
- Per muscle group: 12-18 sets/week
- Frequency: 3-5x per week (upper/lower or PPL)
- Session duration: 60-75 minutes

**Advanced (3-7 weeks):**
- Total weekly sets: 80-140
- Per muscle group: 16-25 sets/week
- Frequency: 4-6x per week (body part splits or DUP)
- Session duration: 60-90 minutes

### Progression Strategies (3-7 Weeks)
1. **Linear Progression**: Add 2.5-10 lbs weekly (best for beginners)
2. **Weekly Undulation**: Light/moderate/heavy weeks
3. **Double Progression**: Add reps, then weight
4. **Wave Loading**: Intensity waves week-to-week
5. **Block Periodization**: Start high volume → end high intensity

### Deload Strategy
- **3-4 week programs**: No deload needed (too short)
- **5-6 week programs**: Optional deload in week 4
- **7 week programs**: Deload week 4 or week 6
- **Deload protocol**: 50-60% volume, 60-70% intensity, maintain frequency

- Behind-neck press
- Very wide-grip bench
- Upright rows (if painful)

**Substitute:**
- Floor press (reduced ROM)
- Landmine press (shoulder-friendly angle)
- Neutral-grip floor press
- Incline bench (moderate incline)
- Front raises instead of upright rows

### Lower Back Issues
**Avoid:**
- Heavy conventional deadlifts from floor
- Good mornings (if acute)
- Low-bar squat

**Substitute:**
- Deadlift from blocks (reduced ROM)
- Trap bar deadlift (if available)
- Front squat (more upright)
- RDL with lighter weight (controlled)
- Safety bar squat (if available)

### Knee Issues
**Avoid:**
- Deep squats (ass-to-grass)
- Heavy front squats
- Lunges (if painful)

**Substitute:**
- Box squat to parallel
- Deadlift variations (less knee flexion)
- RDL (minimal knee bend)
- Good mornings
- Hip thrusts

### Wrist Issues
**Avoid:**
- Straight bar curls
- Low-bar back squat
- Front squat (clean grip)

**Substitute:**
- High-bar back squat
- Front squat with crossed arms
- Overhead press (wrists neutral)
- Reverse curls (less supination)

---

## AGE & SEX CONSIDERATIONS

### Masters Athletes (40+)
- **Warm-up**: 10-15 minutes (longer than youth)
- **Volume**: Start conservative, 10-20% less than younger athletes
- **Intensity**: Can still train heavy, but add 1 RIR
- **Recovery**: May need extra rest day or deload week 4
- **Exercise selection**: Joint-friendly (front squat > back squat, floor press option)
- **Progression**: Slower but steady (add 2.5 lbs vs 5 lbs)
- **Deload**: Every 3-4 weeks vs 4-6 for youth

### Female Athletes
- **Same principles apply**: Progressive overload, periodization
- **Volume tolerance**: Often can handle more frequency/volume
- **Menstrual cycle tracking**:
  - Weeks 1-2 (follicular): Higher performance capacity
  - Weeks 3-4 (luteal): May need slight volume reduction
- **Pregnancy/Postpartum**: Requires medical clearance and modified programming
- **Relative strength**: Often stronger relative to bodyweight in lower body

### Youth/Adolescents (Under 18)
- **Technique first**: Perfect form before loading
- **Conservative progression**: 2.5 lbs max increments
- **Supervision**: Adult coaching/spotting required
- **Volume**: Lower than adults (recovery capacity developing)
- **Exercise selection**: Stick to basics (squat, bench, press, row, deadlift)
- **Avoid**: Max singles, very high intensity (>90% 1RM)

---

## SPORT-SPECIFIC CONSIDERATIONS (3-7 WEEK BLOCKS)

### Powerlifting
- **Focus**: Squat, bench, deadlift specificity
- **Frequency**: Each lift 2-3x per week
- **Variations**: Competition style + variations (pause, tempo, chains)
- **Accessories**: Support main lifts (RDL, close-grip bench, front squat)
- **Peaking**: Weeks 1-4 volume, weeks 5-7 intensity + taper

### Olympic Weightlifting
- **Focus**: Snatch, clean & jerk + positional work
- **Frequency**: 4-6 sessions per week
- **Volume**: Olympic lifts first, squats/pulls second
- **Technique**: High importance, moderate weights (70-85%)
- **Accessories**: Front squat, clean pulls, jerk drives

### Team Sports (Off-Season Block)
- **Frequency**: 3-4 strength sessions per week
- **Focus**: Power + strength (not bodybuilding)
- **Olympic lifts**: High value (clean, snatch, push press)
- **Volume**: Moderate (must balance with sport practice)
- **Accessories**: Injury prevention (single-leg, posterior chain)

### Combat Sports (Training Camp)
- **Frequency**: 2-3 sessions per week (sport practice priority)
- **Focus**: Strength maintenance + power
- **Volume**: LOW (must manage total stress)
- **Exercise selection**: Full body, efficient (no bodypart splits)
- **Intensity**: Moderate-high (maintain strength without fatigue)

### Endurance Sports (Strength Block)
- **Frequency**: 2 full-body sessions per week
- **Focus**: Injury prevention, strength maintenance
- **Volume**: Low-moderate (cardio is priority)

- **Exercise selection**: Compound lifts, functional patterns

---

## VELOCITY-BASED TRAINING (VBT) - Optional

### When to Use VBT (3-7 weeks)
- **Power/Olympic lifting programs**: High value
- **Strength programs**: Useful for autoregulation
- **Hypertrophy programs**: Low value (not the right tool)
- **Beginners**: Not recommended (focus on technique first)

### VBT Implementation (If Equipment Available)
**Velocity Zones by Movement:**
- Olympic lifts: >1.0 m/s (stop if drops below 0.95 m/s)
- Speed squats: 0.75-1.0 m/s target
- Speed bench: 0.5-0.75 m/s target
- Speed deadlifts: 0.6-0.9 m/s target

**Autoregulation Protocol:**
- Day 1: Test average velocity at prescribed load
- If velocity >= threshold: Increase 2.5-5% next session
- If velocity < minimum: Reduce load 5-10%
- Stop set when velocity drops >10% from first rep

**VBT Set Notes Example:**
"Target 1.0 m/s. Stop set if velocity drops below 0.95 m/s"

## IMPLEMENTATION GUIDELINES FOR AI AGENTS

### Program Generation Checklist (3-7 Weeks)
1. ✅ **Assess training level** (beginner/intermediate/advanced)
2. ✅ **Determine primary goal** (strength, hypertrophy, power)
3. ✅ **Select appropriate split** (full body, upper/lower, PPL)
4. ✅ **Choose periodization model** (linear, wave, block)
5. ✅ **Set volume appropriately** (match training level)
6. ✅ **Include deload if 5-7 weeks** (week 4 or 6)
7. ✅ **Balance muscle groups** (push/pull 1:1 ratio)
8. ✅ **Accommodate injuries** (substitute exercises)
9. ✅ **Adjust for age/sex** (volume, intensity, recovery)
10. ✅ **Progressive overload plan** (specific numbers: "+5 lbs/week")
11. ✅ **Include safety notes** (squat/bench/deadlift form cues)
12. ✅ **Set appropriate RIR** (by training level and week)

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
❌ Too much volume for beginners
❌ No deload in 6-7 week programs
❌ Ignoring injury history
❌ Inappropriate exercise selection (dumbbells, machines)
❌ Vague progression ("add weight when ready" - NO! Be specific)
❌ Push/pull imbalance (chest focus with no back work)
❌ Missing safety notes for compound lifts
❌ Using VBT for hypertrophy or beginners
❌ Not adjusting for age/sex
❌ Unclear set/rep schemes

## CONCLUSION

3-7 week mesocycles are the foundation of effective training programming. This duration allows:
- **Meaningful adaptation** (enough time for gains)
- **Focused blocks** (single goal: strength, size, or power)
- **Manageable planning** (not too complex)
- **Progress tracking** (clear beginning and end)
- **Periodization** (progressive overload with strategic deload)

Success in 3-7 week programs requires:
1. **Clear goal** (strength, hypertrophy, or power)
2. **Appropriate volume** (match training level)
3. **Logical progression** (wave loading, linear, or block)
4. **Strategic deload** (if 5+ weeks)
5. **Exercise specificity** (barbell only, support the goal)
6. **Safety emphasis** (proper form, injury accommodation)
7. **Individual factors** (age, sex, sport, injuries)

This medium-length CAG provides all essential knowledge for generating effective 3-7 week barbell training mesocycles.
