# SHORT-TERM BARBELL TRAINING CAG (1-2 Week Programs)
## Focused Knowledge Base for Brief Training Blocks

---

## DOCUMENT PURPOSE & SCOPE

This streamlined CAG document provides essential knowledge for programming **1-2 week barbell training blocks**. These short programs are ideal for:
- Testing/sampling a new training style
- Bridge programs between training phases
- Deload/recovery weeks
- Competition prep (final taper week)
- Introduction to barbell training
- Post-injury return-to-training protocols

**Equipment Required**: Olympic barbell, weight plates, squat rack, bench (adjustable)

**Target outcomes**: Skill development, technique refinement, strength maintenance, hypertrophy stimulus, or active recovery

---

## KEY PRINCIPLES FOR SHORT PROGRAMS

### Volume Guidelines (1-2 Weeks)
Since adaptation requires 3-6 weeks, short programs focus on:
1. **Skill Practice** - Technique refinement on core lifts
2. **Stimulus Maintenance** - Keep current adaptations
3. **Testing** - Assess current abilities
4. **Targeted Work** - Address specific weakness
5. **Recovery** - Active deload between hard blocks

### Training Frequency
- **1-2 week programs**: 2-4 sessions recommended
- Full-body or upper/lower splits work best
- Avoid complex periodization (not enough time)

### Intensity Guidelines
- **Testing/Assessment**: 80-95% 1RM (low volume)
- **Skill Practice**: 60-75% 1RM (moderate volume, perfect reps)
- **Deload**: 50-70% 1RM (reduced volume, 40-50% less than normal)
- **Maintenance**: 70-85% 1RM (moderate volume)

### By Training Goal
**Strength Testing/Peak:**
- Main lifts: 1-5 reps @ 85-95% 1RM
- Accessories: 6-10 reps @ 70-80%
- Volume: LOW (preserve freshness)

**Skill Practice:**
- Main lifts: 5-8 reps @ 65-75% 1RM
- Focus: Perfect technique, speed
- Volume: MODERATE (quality over fatigue)

**Hypertrophy/Maintenance:**
- Main lifts: 6-10 reps @ 70-80% 1RM
- Accessories: 10-15 reps @ 60-70%
- Volume: MODERATE-HIGH

**Deload/Recovery:**
- Main lifts: 5-8 reps @ 50-70% 1RM
- Volume: 40-50% of normal training
- Focus: Movement quality, recovery

### RIR (Reps in Reserve)
- **Beginner (1-2 weeks)**: 3-4 RIR (very conservative)
- **Intermediate**: 2-3 RIR (moderate)
- **Advanced**: 1-2 RIR (can push closer)
- **Deload**: 4-5 RIR (very easy)

### Rest Periods
- Strength/testing: 3-5 minutes
- Hypertrophy: 2-3 minutes
- Accessories: 1.5-2 minutes
- Deload: 2-3 minutes (don't rush)

## SAFETY & TECHNIQUE (CRITICAL FOR SHORT PROGRAMS)

### Injury Prevention
1. **Warm-up properly** - 5-10 minutes, mobility work
2. **Use safety equipment** - squat rack safeties, spotter for bench
3. **Perfect technique first** - Don't ego lift in a 1-2 week program
4. **Listen to pain signals** - Stop if sharp/acute pain

### Exercise-Specific Safety
**Squat:**
- Set safety bars just below parallel depth
- Keep chest up, knees tracking over toes
- Bail safely if needed (dump bar on safeties)

**Bench Press:**
- ALWAYS use spotter or safety bars
- Keep wrists straight, full grip (not thumbless)
- Control descent, don't bounce off chest

**Deadlift:**
- Neutral spine throughout (no rounding)
- Bar stays close to shins/thighs
- Hip hinge pattern, not squat pattern

**Overhead Press:**
- Clear face, press in straight line
- Tight core, glutes engaged
- Avoid excessive back arch

## INJURY ACCOMMODATIONS

### Common Modifications (1-2 weeks allows conservative approach)
**Shoulder Issues:**
- Avoid: Behind-neck press, wide-grip bench
- Use: Neutral-grip bench, floor press, landmine press

**Lower Back:**
- Avoid: Heavy deadlifts from floor
- Use: Deadlift from blocks, front squat, RDL (lighter)

**Knee:**
- Avoid: Deep squats, heavy loading
- Use: Box squat to parallel, RDL, good mornings

**Wrist:**
- Avoid: Straight bar curls, low-bar squat
- Use: High-bar squat, front squat (crossed arms)

**Current/Acute Injury:**
- Seek medical clearance
- Work around injury, not through it
- Use this 1-2 week period for assessment

---

## AGE & SEX CONSIDERATIONS

### Masters Athletes (40+)
- Extended warm-up: 10-15 minutes
- More conservative intensity: Add 1-2 RIR
- Joint-friendly exercises: Front squat > back squat, floor press option
- Focus on quality movement

### Female Athletes
- Same progressive overload principles
- May tolerate higher frequency well
- Track menstrual cycle if applicable (Week 1-14 = higher performance)
- Adjust volume based on recovery signals

### Youth/Adolescents
- Technique emphasis (perfect form before load)
- Conservative progression (safety first)
- Simpler programs (limit exercise variety)
- Adult supervision for safety

## IMPLEMENTATION FOR 1-2 WEEK PROGRAMS

### AI Agent Checklist
1. ✅ **Determine program purpose** (testing, deload, bridge, intro)
2. ✅ **Select 5-8 total exercises** (keep it simple)
3. ✅ **Set appropriate intensity** (60-95% based on purpose)
4. ✅ **Choose 2-4 sessions** (don't overschedule)
5. ✅ **Include safety notes** (especially for beginners)
6. ✅ **Accommodate injuries** (use modifications)
7. ✅ **Set realistic expectations** (limited adaptation time)
8. ✅ **Provide clear instructions** (form cues, rest times)

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
❌ Complex periodization (not enough time)
❌ Too much volume (can't recover in 1-2 weeks)
❌ Too many exercises (keep it focused)
❌ Ignoring safety (no time for injury recovery)
❌ Unclear purpose (define the goal upfront)

## CONCLUSION

1-2 week barbell programs serve specific, focused purposes: testing, deloading, bridging, or introducing. Success requires:
- **Clear purpose** (why this short block?)
- **Appropriate intensity** (match purpose to load)
- **Simple structure** (5-8 exercises, 2-4 sessions)
- **Safety emphasis** (injury ends the program immediately)
- **Realistic expectations** (meaningful adaptation takes 3-6+ weeks)

This short CAG provides all essential knowledge for generating effective 1-2 week barbell training programs.
