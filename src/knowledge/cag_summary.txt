# CONDENSED STRENGTH & CONDITIONING KNOWLEDGE BASE
## Quick Reference for Conversational Agent

---

## 1. CORE TRAINING PRINCIPLES

### Progressive Overload
Systematic increase in training stress through:
- **Load**: Add 2.5-5% weight when targets exceeded
- **Volume**: Add sets/reps gradually
- **Intensity**: Reduce RIR (get closer to failure)
- **Frequency**: Increase training sessions

**Progression Rate by Level**:
- Novice: Session-to-session (add weight each workout)
- Intermediate: Week-to-week (add weight weekly)
- Advanced: Block-to-block (every 4-12 weeks)

### Key Adaptation Mechanisms
- **Mechanical Tension**: Primary hypertrophy driver (heavy loads + TUT)
- **Metabolic Stress**: Accumulation via higher reps (8-20)
- **Neural Adaptations**: Motor unit recruitment (60-80% of novice strength gains)
- **Muscle Damage**: Controlled microdamage triggers growth

---

## 2. TRAINING VARIABLES

### Volume (Weekly Sets per Muscle)
- **Novice**: 6-12 sets/week
- **Intermediate**: 10-18 sets/week  
- **Advanced**: 14-25+ sets/week

**Volume Landmarks**:
- MV (Maintenance): 4-6 sets
- MEV (Minimum Effective): 6-10 sets
- MAV (Maximum Adaptive): 12-20 sets
- MRV (Maximum Recoverable): 18-30+ sets (highly individual)

### Intensity & Rep Ranges by Goal
- **Strength**: 1-6 reps @ 80-95% 1RM, 0-2 RIR
- **Hypertrophy**: 6-20 reps @ 60-85% 1RM, 0-3 RIR
- **Power**: 1-5 reps @ 30-70% 1RM, 4-6 RIR (never failure)
- **Endurance**: 15-20+ reps @ 40-60% 1RM

### Frequency
- Optimal: 2-3 sessions per muscle per week
- Allows higher total volume without excessive per-session fatigue
- Stimulates protein synthesis multiple times per week

### Rest Periods
- **Strength**: 3-5+ minutes (full recovery)
- **Hypertrophy**: 2-3 minutes (balance recovery and efficiency)
- **Power**: 3-5+ minutes (velocity dependent)
- **Metabolic**: 30-90 seconds

---

## 3. PROXIMITY TO FAILURE (RIR/RPE)

### RIR Scale
- **0 RIR** = Failure (no more reps possible)
- **1 RIR** = Could do 1 more rep
- **2 RIR** = Could do 2 more reps
- **3+ RIR** = Easier/warm-up sets

### RPE-Based (10-point scale)
- RPE 10 = 0 RIR (failure)
- RPE 9 = 1 RIR
- RPE 8 = 2 RIR
- RPE 7 = 3 RIR

### Application by Goal
- **Hypertrophy**: 0-3 RIR (most sets at 1-2 RIR)
- **Strength**: 0-2 RIR on heavy sets, 2-3 RIR on volume
- **Power**: Never approach failure (4-6 RIR)

**Key Finding**: Training 1-3 RIR produces similar results to failure for hypertrophy when volume equated; failure not required but proximity matters.

---

## 4. PERIODIZATION MODELS

### Linear Periodization
- Gradual increase in intensity, decrease in volume
- Weeks 1-4: High volume (8-12 reps)
- Weeks 5-8: Moderate (5-8 reps)
- Weeks 9-12: Low volume, high intensity (1-5 reps)
- **Best for**: Novices, simple progression

### Undulating Periodization (DUP)
- Frequent variation in intensity/volume (daily or weekly)
- Example: Mon = Hypertrophy, Wed = Power, Fri = Strength
- **Best for**: Intermediates/advanced, prevents adaptation
- **Research**: May produce superior strength gains vs linear in trained lifters

### Block Periodization
- Sequential focused blocks (3-6 weeks each)
- Block 1: Accumulation (volume, 60-75%)
- Block 2: Intensification (strength, 80-90%)
- Block 3: Realization (peaking, 90-95%+)
- **Best for**: Advanced athletes, competition prep

## 7. NUTRITION ESSENTIALS

### Protein Requirements
- **General athletes**: 1.6-2.2 g/kg/day
- **Fat loss**: 1.8-2.4 g/kg/day (higher end for aggressive deficits)
- **Strength focus**: 1.6-2.0 g/kg/day
- **Masters (40+)**: 1.8-2.4 g/kg/day (anabolic resistance)

### Distribution
- **Meals**: 4-6 per day with 20-40g protein each
- **Timing**: Protein within 2-3 hours pre/post workout
- **Before bed**: 30-40g slow-digesting protein (casein)

### Calories by Goal
- **Muscle gain**: +10-20% surplus (+200-500 kcal)
- **Fat loss**: -10-25% deficit (-250-500 kcal)
- **Maintenance**: At TDEE

### Macros

## 8. DELOAD STRATEGIES

### When to Deload
- **Planned**: Every 3-6 weeks (most common: every 4 weeks)
- **Reactive**: Performance plateau, excessive soreness, joint pain, fatigue

### Deload Methods
1. **Volume Reduction** (most common): Reduce sets 40-60%, maintain intensity
2. **Intensity Reduction**: Reduce load 20-40%, maintain volume
3. **Combined**: Reduce both 30-40%

**Duration**: 5-7 days

### Deload vs Taper
- **Deload**: Integrated regularly, facilitates progression
- **Taper**: Before competition, 7-14 days, peak performance

---

## 9. OLYMPIC WEIGHTLIFTING

### Benefits
- Highest power output of all movements (55.8 W/kg on clean second pull)
- Superior RFD development (22,000 N·s-1 vs 5,000 N·s-1 squat)
- Athletic transfer: triple extension mimics jumping/sprinting
- Develops explosive strength across force-velocity continuum

### Full Lifts vs Derivatives
- **Full lifts** (snatch, clean & jerk): Maximum development, long learning curve
- **Pulls**: Easier to learn, focus on hip extension, can load heavier
- **Hang variations**: Reduce technical demand, less mobility required
- **Power variations**: Faster learning, still develops power

### Programming
- **Frequency**: 2-6 sessions/week (sport dependent)
- **Intensity**: 60-85% for technique, 85-95% for strength
- **Volume**: 8-15 weekly sets
- **Never train to failure**: Destroys technique and velocity

---

## 10. CONCURRENT TRAINING

### Interference Effect
Combining endurance + resistance may attenuate strength/hypertrophy vs resistance alone

**Key Findings**:
- Running > cycling for interference
- High-frequency/long-duration endurance increases interference
- HIIT produces less interference than steady-state
- 6+ hours separation OR resistance first reduces interference

### Minimizing Interference
1. **Separate sessions** by 6+ hours or different days
2. **Prioritize** primary goal (perform first when fresh)
3. **Choose cycling/rowing** over running
4. **Moderate endurance volume** (2-3 sessions, 20-40 min)
5. **Increase protein** to 2.0-2.4 g/kg/day
6. **Monitor total stress** carefully

---

## 11. SPECIAL POPULATIONS

### Female Athletes
- Similar volume tolerance or higher than males
- May recover faster between sets
- Menstrual cycle: follicular = better performance, luteal = slightly reduced (individual variation huge)
- Benefit equally from progressive overload principles

### Masters Athletes (40+)
- **Longer warm-ups**: 10-15 min
- **More recovery**: Extra day between sessions may be needed
- **Higher protein**: 1.8-2.4 g/kg/day (anabolic resistance)
- **Joint-friendly exercises**: Trap bar, safety bar, machines
- **Deload more often**: Every 3-4 weeks vs 4-6

### Return from Injury
- Start at 50-60% pre-injury loads

- Persistent soreness (>3 days)
- Joint aches that don't resolve
- Sleep disruption
- Loss of motivation
- Elevated resting HR

---

## 15. TESTING & ASSESSMENT

### Strength Testing
- **Frequency**: Every 8-12 weeks
- **After**: Deload week (well-rested)
- **Protocol**: Warm-up, build to 1RM in 3-5 attempts
- **Alternative**: Use rep maxes with formulas (3-8 reps most accurate)

### Body Composition
- **Best methods**: DEXA, Bod Pod (±2-3% error)
- **Practical**: Photos + measurements + scale weight
- **Frequency**: Every 2-4 weeks
- **Key metric**: Trend over time, not single measurement

### Performance Testing
- Vertical jump (power)
- Sprint times (speed-strength)
- Sport-specific tests
- Conditioning benchmarks

- High volume + aggressive caloric deficit
- Frequent failure training for beginners
- Zero deloads for 12+ weeks
- <1.0 g/kg protein for muscle building

**Safety Notes**:
- Any pain (not soreness) = stop and modify
- Form breakdown = reduce load
- Get medical clearance if sedentary >6 months
- Start conservative, progress gradually
- Respect individual recovery capacity

---

## SUMMARY: KEY PRINCIPLES

1. **Progressive Overload**: Must increase stress over time (load, volume, intensity, or frequency)

2. **Volume Dose-Response**: More sets = more growth (up to individual limit of 18-30 sets/muscle)

3. **Proximity to Failure**: 0-3 RIR for hypertrophy, don't need absolute failure

4. **Frequency**: 2-3x per muscle per week optimal for most

5. **Periodization**: Variation prevents adaptation and manages fatigue

6. **Recovery**: Deload every 3-6 weeks, monitor fatigue markers

7. **Nutrition**: 1.6-2.4 g/kg protein, appropriate calories for goal

8. **Individualization**: Training level dictates progression rate and volume tolerance

9. **Specificity**: Train the adaptations you want (strength = heavy loads, power = velocity)

10. **Consistency**: Long-term adherence > perfect program
