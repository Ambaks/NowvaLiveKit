## 1. INJURY REHABILITATION AND PREVENTION

### Ankle Sprain Rehabilitation

**Classification and Recovery Timelines**

Grade I ankle sprains (mild ligament stretch, minimal swelling) typically resolve within **5-14 days**. Grade II sprains (partial ATFL tear, moderate swelling) require **2-4 weeks** for recovery. Grade III injuries (complete ligament tears) demand **3-12+ weeks** depending on intervention approach.

**Mobility Restoration Protocol**

Begin with alphabet exercises—drawing letters with the foot to restore multi-planar range of motion. Progress to banded joint mobilizations applying posterior talar glide, which research by Green et al. demonstrates improves dorsiflexion. Perform **2-3 sets of 10-15 repetitions** of ankle circles in both directions.

**Strengthening Progressions**

Phase 1 (Isometrics): Sub-maximal isometric contractions in plantarflexion, dorsiflexion, inversion, and eversion—**5-10 second holds for 10 repetitions**. Phase 2 (Isotonics): Resisted ankle exercises with resistance bands (4-way ankle), progressing from bilateral to unilateral calf raises—**3 sets of 10-15 reps**. Phase 3 (Plyometrics): Jump landing drills progressing bilateral to unilateral, box jumps, lateral bounds.

**Proprioception Training**

Weeks 1-2: Single-leg stance on stable surface (**30-60 seconds**). Weeks 2-4: Wobble board or BOSU training. Weeks 4+: Single-leg stance with perturbations and eyes-closed challenges. Research by Wester et al. demonstrated 12-week wobble-board training reduced reinjury rates from **54% to 25%**.

**Return-to-Sport Criteria**

Achieve ≥**90% Limb Symmetry Index (LSI)** on single-leg hop tests including side hop, triple hop, and crossover hop tests. Full pain-free range of motion required. Pass sport-specific agility testing and heel rise test clearance before returning to running.

### Shoulder Impingement and Rotator Cuff Rehabilitation

**SITS Muscle Strengthening**

Phase 1 (Weeks 1-2): Grade 1-2 joint mobilizations, pendulum exercises for 1-2 minutes, submaximal isometrics. Avoid positions above shoulder height. Phase 2 (Weeks 2-6): Full-can raises preferred over empty-can (reduces impingement forces per Yanai et al.), side-lying external rotation—**3 sets of 8-12 reps**. Phase 3 (Weeks 6+): External rotation at 90° abduction, eccentric loading, sport-specific progression.

**Scapular Stability Exercises**

For lower trapezius activation: prone Y-raises (highest activation), prone flexion, high scapular retraction. For serratus anterior: push-up plus shows **18-45% greater activation** over upper trapezius, dynamic hug exercise, towel-wall slides. Research by Cools et al. recommends targeting exercises with low UT/LT and UT/SA ratios.

**External Rotation Strength Ratios**

Target **ER:IR ratio of 66-75%** for healthy shoulders. Overhead athletes may need higher external rotation strength. Assess via isokinetic testing at 60°/sec and 180°/sec.

### Knee Injury Rehabilitation

**ACL Rehabilitation Phases**

Phase 1 (Weeks 0-2): Control swelling, restore extension, quad activation through NMES, heel slides, quad sets. Phase 2 (Weeks 2-8): Full ROM, gait normalization via closed kinetic chain exercises, stationary bike. Phase 3 (Weeks 8-16): Return to running typically at 12 weeks (criterion-based). Phase 4 (Weeks 16-24): Plyometrics, agility, sport-specific drills. Phase 5 (Months 6-12): Return to sport.

Athletes returning before 9 months are **7× more likely** to re-tear their ACL. Each month delayed up to 9 months provides **51% reduced re-injury rate**.

**Quad-to-Hamstring Strength Ratios**

Conventional ratio (Concentric H/Concentric Q): Target **0.6-0.8 (60-80%)** for athletic activity, **1.0 (100%)** for optimal ACL stability. Functional ratio (Eccentric H/Concentric Q): Target **1.0 at speeds >120°/sec**—more relevant to injury prevention.

**Patellar Tendinopathy Protocols (Jill Cook Research)**

Stage 1—Isometric Loading: **45-second holds × 5 reps at 70% MVIC**, performed 2-4 times daily. Reduces pain immediately for approximately 45 minutes. Rio et al. demonstrated **6.8/10 mean pain reduction** post-isometric versus 2.6/10 post-isotonic.

Stage 2—Heavy Slow Resistance: Squats, hack squats, leg press progressing from **15RM to 6RM** over time. Use slow tempo (6-8 second eccentric). Kongsgaard et al. found **70% patient satisfaction** with HSR versus 22% with eccentric-only protocols.

Pain monitoring rules: Acceptable pain ≤3/10 during exercise that returns to baseline within 24 hours. Unacceptable: increasing pain with increasing load.

### Lower Back Pain Management

**McGill Big 3 Protocols**

Modified Curl-Up: Lie supine with one knee bent at 90°, hands under lumbar curve. Lift head and shoulders as one unit—**hold 10 seconds × 5-10 reps per side**. Progress using 5-3-1 pyramid.

Side Bridge: Start with knees bent at 90° (beginner), progress to full side plank from feet/elbow—**hold 10 seconds × 5-10 reps per side**, building to 60-second single hold.

Bird Dog: Quadruped position, raise opposite arm and leg simultaneously, maintaining spine stability—**hold 10 seconds × 5-10 reps per side**. Progress to continuous "sweep the floor" motion.

Program frequency: **2× daily (morning and evening), 5-6 days/week**.

**Flexion vs Extension-Biased Approaches**

Extension-biased (most common): For patients who feel better standing/walking, worse with sitting/bending. Flexion-biased: For patients with stenosis symptoms who feel better sitting. Key principle: Avoid the movement direction that triggers symptoms.

**Deadlift Return Progressions**

Phase 1: Hip hinge patterning, core stability. Phase 2: Kettlebell deadlift, light RDLs. Phase 3: Trap bar deadlift (reduced spinal stress). Phase 4: Block pulls (reduced ROM). Phase 5: Full conventional or sumo deadlift. Progress load gradually in **10% increments**, monitoring 24-hour symptom response.

### Hip Impingement Considerations

**Movement Modifications**

Reduce squat depth to decrease hip flexion angle. Adopt wider stance with toes turned out **15-30°** to create more hip space. Use box squats to control depth. Alternative exercises include split squats and leg press.

**Strengthening Without Aggravation**

Train in pain-free zone (≤2/10 pain). Level 1: Glute bridges, supine hip flexion isometrics, clamshells. Level 2: Standing hip flexion with band, split squats with limited depth. Level 3: Deficit rear foot elevated split squats, RDLs, trap bar deadlifts.

FAI patients show up to **30% strength deficit** in glutes, hip flexors, and groin muscles. Research recommends **2-3 days/week strengthening for 3+ months**.

### Elbow Tendinopathy Protocols

**Tyler Twist Protocol (Lateral Epicondylitis)**

Using a FlexBar: Hold in involved hand with wrist extended, grasp upper end with uninvolved hand, twist bar, extend both elbows forward maintaining twist, slowly release/untwist with involved side (eccentric wrist extension). Perform **3 sets × 15 repetitions daily** for 6+ weeks. Tyler et al. study showed **81% improvement** in FlexBar group versus 15% in standard treatment.

**Isometric Pain Management**

Wrist extension/flexion isometrics against wall—**45-second holds × 5 reps**, multiple times daily. Use as warm-up before eccentric loading.

### Prehabilitation Protocols

**Rotator Cuff Prehab (2-3× per week, 10-15 minutes)**

Banded external rotation at 0° abduction: 2 × 15. Banded pull-aparts: 2 × 15. Prone Y-T-W: 2 × 10 each. Side-lying external rotation: 2 × 12. Push-up plus: 2 × 10.

**Knee Prehab for Athletes (2-3× per week)**

Nordic hamstring curls: 3 × 5-8 (eccentric emphasis). Single-leg squats: 3 × 8 each. Single-leg RDLs: 3 × 10 each. Lateral band walks: 2 × 15 each direction. Nordic curl programs reduce hamstring injury risk by up to **50%**.

### Red Flags Requiring Medical Referral

**Cauda Equina Syndrome (IMMEDIATE EMERGENCY)**: Bilateral leg pain/weakness, saddle anesthesia (perineum numbness), bladder/bowel dysfunction, progressive motor weakness.

**Fracture Signs**: Inability to weight-bear (4 steps), point tenderness over bone, significant trauma mechanism, deformity or crepitus.

**Systemic Warning Signs**: Night pain waking from sleep, unexplained weight loss >10% in 3-6 months, fever, history of cancer, immunosuppression.

**Mechanical Red Flags**: Locked joints (inability to fully extend/flex), true mechanical instability with giving way.

### Return-to-Play Criteria

**LSI Benchmarks**: ≥**90% LSI** across all strength and hop tests. Testing battery includes isokinetic quad/hamstring strength, single-leg hop for distance, triple hop, crossover hop, and 6-meter timed hop.

**Psychological Readiness**: Assess using ACL-Return to Sport after Injury (ACL-RSI) scale, Knee Self-Efficacy Scale, Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia. Key indicators include confidence in injured limb, absence of fear of re-injury, and completion of sport-specific practice without hesitation.

## 2. MOBILITY AND FLEXIBILITY PROTOCOLS

### Ankle Dorsiflexion Improvement

**Assessment and Norms**

Normal dorsiflexion ROM: **35-40° passive**, 10-20° considered functional minimum. Weight-Bearing Lunge Test (WBLT): Measure knee-to-wall distance—**10-12cm minimum** for general population, **12-15cm** for elite athletes. Limited dorsiflexion is linked to ACL injury, plantar fasciitis, ankle sprains, and squat depth limitations.

**Specific Protocols**

Wall Ankle Mobilizations: Stand facing wall with target foot 10-15cm away, lunge forward driving knee over toes while keeping heel down—**2-3 sets × 10-15 reps** each ankle, holding end position 2-3 seconds.

Banded Joint Mobilizations: Place resistance band low around ankle, secured behind. Band applies posterior glide to talus during active dorsiflexion. Weight-bearing MWM techniques are more effective than non-weight-bearing per PMC studies—**2-3 sets × 8-12 reps**, spending 3-5 seconds in end range.

**Expected Improvement Timelines**

Acute improvements: **3-5° or 6-22mm (WBLT)** immediately post-intervention. Sustained improvement: 2-6 week programs show **2-5.3° improvements** with home exercise. Multiple sessions required for lasting changes.

### Hip Mobility for Squatting

**90/90 Progressions**

Basic position: Front leg hip flexed 90°, knee bent 90°, external rotation. Back leg hip abducted 90°, knee bent 90°, internal rotation. Target **2 minutes per side, daily practice**. Contraindicated for hip impingement, hip/knee replacements.

PAILs & RAILs Protocol: 2 minutes passive stretch, 20-30 second ramping PAILs contraction (push front shin into floor), 20-30 second RAILs contraction (attempt to lift rear leg), deepen stretch, repeat **3-5 cycles**.

**Hip Flexor Lengthening**

Couch Stretch: Back foot elevated on wall or couch, front foot forward in lunge. Squeeze glute of back leg, maintain neutral spine—**2 minutes per side**. Progress to adding posterior pelvic tilt, then overhead reach.

Half-Kneeling Hip Flexor Stretch: Rear knee on pad, squeeze glutes with slight posterior pelvic tilt—**30-60 seconds, 2-3 sets per side**.

**Adductor Mobility**

Frog Stretch: On all fours, widen knees, rock back toward heels—**2-3 sets × 30-60 seconds**. Cossack Squat: Wide stance, shift weight to one leg while keeping other leg straight—**8-10 reps per side**.

### Thoracic Spine Mobility

**Extension Drills**

Foam Roller Thoracic Extensions: Roller perpendicular to spine at mid-back, support head with hands, extend over roller. Movement should isolate thoracic spine—do NOT let lower back arch. Perform **10-15 extensions at each segment**, moving roller from T6-T12.

**Rotation Exercises**

Open Books: Side-lying with knees stacked at 90°, top arm reaches across body then opens to opposite side. Keep knees together, lead with eyes—**8-10 reps per side**, exhaling into end range.

Thread the Needle: From quadruped, reach under opposite arm rotating thoracic spine, return and reach toward ceiling—**8-10 reps per side**.

Research finding: Thoracic hypomobility can limit shoulder ROM by **>20%** during overhead reaching (Kebaetse et al., 1999). Compensatory lumbar extension often occurs when T-spine is restricted.

### Shoulder Mobility

**Lat and Teres Major Lengthening**

Foam Roller Lat Stretch: Side-lying with roller under armpit, arm overhead—**90-120 seconds per side**. Hanging Lat Stretch: Dead hang from pull-up bar, progress to active hang—**30-60 seconds, 2-3 sets**.

**External Rotation Norms for Olympic Lifts**

Target **65-70° of pure glenohumeral external rotation**. Assess supine with arm at 90° abduction, 90° elbow flexion. For full overhead position, **170-180° shoulder flexion** required.

### Static vs Dynamic Stretching Evidence

**Pre-Workout Impact**

Meta-analysis findings (Simic et al., 2013, 104 studies): Static stretching impairs maximal strength by **-5.4%**, power by **-1.9%**, explosive performance by **-2.0%**.

**Critical Duration Threshold (Chaabene et al., 2019)**

≤60 seconds per muscle group: Trivial negative effects (**Δ1-2%**). >60 seconds per muscle group: Substantial impairment (**Δ4.0-7.5%**). Recent 2024 meta-analysis: Static stretching <45 seconds shows no significant decrease in strength, power, or speed.

**Protocol Guidelines**

| Context | Duration | Sets |
|---------|----------|------|
| Post-workout | 15-30 sec | 2-4 per muscle |
| Pre-workout (if needed) | <45-60 sec total | 1-2 |
| Dedicated flexibility session | 30-60 sec | 2-4 per muscle |
| Corrective/therapeutic | 60-120 sec | 2-3 |

### Foam Rolling Evidence

**What Foam Rolling Actually Does**

Increases ROM without negative impact on muscle performance. Reduces DOMS perception through neurological mechanisms rather than structural fascial changes. Effects are likely neurological rather than permanent tissue changes.

**Effective Durations**

Pre-workout: **30-60 seconds per area**. Post-workout: **60-120 seconds per area**. Recovery sessions: **90-120+ seconds per area**. Research shows rolling lasting at least **120 seconds** provides significantly better post-exercise recovery (Michalak et al., 2024).

**Contraindications**

Open wounds, recent fractures, DVT or blood clotting disorders, acute injuries within 72 hours, directly over joints, pregnancy (certain areas).

## 3. PLYOMETRICS AND POWER DEVELOPMENT

### Vertical Jump Training

**Evidence-Based Parameters**

Training duration: **6-12 week programs** produce significant vertical jump improvements. Frequency: **2-3 sessions/week** optimal—moderate frequency produces similar or greater efficiency than high frequency. Research shows moderate training frequency (2 days/week, 840 jumps over 7 weeks) produces approximately **12% improvement** with **0.014% gain per jump**.

**Volume Recommendations (Foot Contacts per Session)**

| Training Level | Foot Contacts/Session | Weekly Total |
|----------------|----------------------|--------------|
| Beginner | 80-100 | 160-200 |
| Intermediate | 100-120 | 200-360 |
| Advanced | 120-140 (up to 200) | 250-400 |

Source: Potach & Chu (2008); Chu & Myer (2013)

**Squat Jump vs Countermovement Jump**

Squat jump: Purely concentric, eliminates stretch reflex, develops concentric-only power. Countermovement jump: Uses eccentric pre-stretch, develops SSC efficiency, sport-specific for most movements. CMJ typically produces **10-15% greater jump height** than SJ due to elastic energy contribution.

### Bodyweight Plyometric Progressions

**Beginner Level (0-3 months)**

Exercises: Pogo jumps/ankle bounces, squat jumps with reset, line hops, box step-ups. Technique cues: Land softly ("quiet landings"), absorb through full kinetic chain, maintain neutral spine, "stick" landings for 2-3 seconds. Volume: **50-80 contacts/session, 2 sessions/week**.

**Intermediate Level (3-12 months)**

Exercises: Box jumps (step down), broad jumps, split squat jumps, lateral bounds, hurdle hops, skipping/bounding. Cues: Minimize ground contact time, "spring-like" behavior, full hip extension at takeoff. Volume: **80-120 contacts/session, 2-3 sessions/week**.

**Advanced Level (12+ months)**

Exercises: Single-leg bounds, depth jumps, continuous hurdle jumps, depth jump to box jump combinations. Cues: Ground contact **<250ms** (fast SSC), pre-tension muscles before contact, maintain ankle stiffness. Volume: **120-200 contacts/session**.

**Progression Criteria**

Beginner to Intermediate: Can perform 3×10 squat jumps with proper form, RSI-modified ≥0.4 on CMJ, no pain, 4+ weeks consistent training. Intermediate to Advanced: Squat ≥**1.5× bodyweight**, RSI ≥**1.5** on drop jump test, demonstrated landing competency, 6+ months consistent plyometric training.

### Depth Jump Protocols

**Optimal Box Heights**

| Purpose | Box Height | Ground Contact |
|---------|-----------|----------------|
| Reactive strength/explosive power | 30-60cm (12-24") | <200ms |
| Speed-strength development | 40-50cm (16-20") | 130-180ms |
| Maximum strength development | 75-110cm (30-42") | Longer amortization |

**Determining Individual Optimal Height**

Protocol: Start at 20cm, increase by 10cm increments. Measure jump height and ground contact time at each height. Optimal height identified when RSI is maintained or improved and contact time remains **<250ms**. When RSI drops or contact time exceeds 250ms, you've exceeded optimal height.

**Volume and Frequency Guidelines**

Per session: **10-40 contacts** (most sources recommend <40). Verkhoshansky protocol: 3-5 sets × 10 reps. Maximum frequency: **1-2 sessions per week**. Recovery: **72+ hours** between sessions. High CNS demand—cannot combine with other high-intensity neural work.

**Prerequisites**

Squat ≥**1.5× bodyweight** (some sources recommend 2×). Training age: **6-12 months** of plyometric training. Master altitude drops first (force absorption only). RSI baseline ≥**1.5** on lower box heights.

### Reactive Strength Index

**RSI Calculation**: Jump Height (m) / Ground Contact Time (s)

**Normative Data**

| RSI Score | Classification | Training Recommendation |
|-----------|---------------|------------------------|
| <1.0 | Poor | Focus on strength, low-intensity plyometrics |
| 1.0-1.5 | Fair | Moderate plyometrics, continue strength |
| 1.5-2.0 | Good | Moderate-high intensity plyometrics |
| 2.0-2.5 | Very Good | High-intensity plyometrics appropriate |
| 2.5-3.0+ | Excellent | Elite reactive ability |

### Rate of Force Development Training

**Ballistic Training Methods**

Key exercises: Jump squats (**30-60% 1RM**), weighted jumps (20-40% 1RM), medicine ball throws, Olympic lift derivatives, ballistic bench press throws (30-50% 1RM). Programming: **3-6 reps** per set, **3-6 sets**, **2-3 minutes** rest minimum, maximum velocity intent on every rep.

**Speed-Strength Continuum**

| Quality | Load | Velocity |
|---------|------|----------|
| Absolute Strength | 85-100% | Low |
| Strength-Speed | 75-90% | Moderate |
| Speed-Strength | 30-60% | High |
| Absolute Speed | 0-30% | Maximum |

### Complex Training (Post-Activation Potentiation)

**Optimal Loading for PAP**

Minimum effective load: **65% 1RM**. Optimal intensity: **85-90% 1RM** for greater effects. Volume: **1-3 sets of 1-5 reps**. Leave 2+ reps in reserve (avoid failure).

**Rest Intervals (Meta-Analysis Findings)**

| Rest Interval | Effect | Recommendation |
|---------------|--------|----------------|
| 0-3 minutes | Negative (fatigue dominant) | Too short |
| 4-7 minutes | Small positive | Minimum effective |
| 8-12 minutes | Medium positive | Optimal range |
| ≥16 minutes | Small positive | PAP may be diminishing |

Practical recommendation: **3-12 minutes**, with **7-8 minutes** optimal for most athletes.

**Exercise Pairings**

Lower body: Back squat → box jump or vertical jump. Trap bar deadlift → broad jump. Upper body: Bench press → plyometric push-up or medicine ball chest pass.

**Individual Response Factors**

Stronger athletes potentiate more effectively. Higher fast-twitch percentage = greater PAP. Relative strength ≥**1.75× BW squat** associated with better response. Individual optimal rest varies 2-12 minutes—requires testing.

### French Contrast Method

**Protocol Structure (Cal Dietz/Gilles Cometti)**

Four-exercise sequence: Heavy compound lift (**2-3 reps @ 80-87% 1RM**) → Force-oriented plyometric (3-5 reps) → Weighted/light loaded jump (**3-5 reps @ 20-30% 1RM**) → Assisted/reactive plyometric (3-5 reps).

Rest intervals: **10-20 seconds** between exercises within complex, **3-5 minutes** between complete sets.

**Example Lower Body Protocol**

Back squat: 3 @ 85% → Hurdle jump: 4 reps → Trap bar jump: 4 @ 20% → Drop jump + sprint: 3 reps.

**Volume and Frequency**

Sets per session: **3-6 total complexes**. Sessions per week: **2-3** (non-consecutive days). Block duration: **3-4 weeks**. Best application: 3-4 weeks prior to competition/peak.

## 4. NUTRITION FUNDAMENTALS

### Protein Intake Recommendations

**By Training Goal**

Muscle building (optimal hypertrophy): **1.6-2.2 g/kg/day**. Morton meta-analysis (2018, Br J Sports Med) found breakpoint at **1.62 g/kg/day** with 95% CI of 1.03-2.2 g/kg/day. Stronger by Science analysis suggests optimal may be **2.0-2.35 g/kg/day**.

Strength athletes: **1.6-2.2 g/kg/day**. Beginners and older adults benefit from higher end (**2.0-2.2 g/kg/day**).

Fat loss/caloric deficit: **2.3-3.1 g/kg/day** to maximize lean body mass retention (ISSN Position). During energy deficit, amino acid catabolism increases, requiring higher intake.

**Age-Related Considerations**

Older adults (≥65 years) show significant lean body mass effects at **1.2-1.59 g/kg/day** (lower threshold than younger adults). Higher absolute protein intake critical due to "anabolic resistance."

### Protein Timing and Distribution

**Anabolic Window Evidence**

Current evidence: The anabolic effect of exercise lasts **at least 24 hours**, but likely diminishes with increasing time. 2013 meta-analysis of 43 studies found **no strong link** between immediate protein intake and muscle growth when training in fed state. Exception: If training fasted, immediate post-workout protein is more important.

**Distribution Throughout Day**

**20-40g per meal** (or **0.25-0.40 g/kg/meal**) is recommended. Doses should be distributed **every 3-4 hours**. Mamerow et al. (2014) found evenly distributing protein increased 24-hour MPS by **~25%** compared to skewed distribution.

**Leucine Threshold**

**2.5-3g leucine per meal** required to maximally stimulate MPS. ISSN recommends **700-3000 mg leucine** per acute protein dose. For older adults: **3-4g leucine/meal** may be needed. High-leucine sources: whey protein (~10% leucine), chicken, fish, beef, eggs.

**Pre-Sleep Protein**

**30-40g casein** before sleep (30 minutes before) increases overnight MPS. Res et al. found MPS was **~22% higher** with 40g pre-sleep casein versus placebo. 12-week study showed greater muscle mass and strength gains with 27.5g pre-sleep protein.

### Carbohydrate Periodization

**By Training Demand**

High carb days (glycogen-demanding): **8-12 g/kg/day** for endogenous glycogen maximization. Low carb days (recovery, low intensity): **2-3 g/kg/day**.

Strength/power athletes: **3-5 g/kg/day** for moderate training, **5-7 g/kg/day** for heavy loads. Endurance athletes: **6-10 g/kg/day** depending on volume.

**Glycogen Replenishment**

Post-exercise: **1.0-1.2 g/kg/hour** for first 4 hours after exhaustive exercise. Moderate to high glycemic index carbohydrates recommended. Full muscle glycogen replenishment takes approximately **24 hours** with adequate carbohydrate.

### Pre and Post-Workout Nutrition

**Pre-Workout Timing**

2-4 hours before: Complete meal (400-800 calories) with carbs, protein, moderate fat. 1-2 hours before: Smaller meal (300-400 calories), lower fiber and fat. <1 hour before: Liquid or easily digestible foods, simple carbs. General rule: **1g carbohydrate/kg** at 1 hour, **2g/kg** at 2 hours.

**Post-Workout**

**20-40g protein** + carbohydrates optimizes recovery. Timing: 0-2 hours post-exercise traditional recommendation, but muscle remains responsive for **24+ hours**. If training fasted, eat as soon as practical. Total daily protein intake matters MORE than precise timing.

### Hydration Guidelines

**Pre-Exercise**: **500 ml** 2-3 hours before, **300-360 ml** 10-20 minutes before. **During Exercise**: **3-8 oz every 10-20 minutes**; aim to prevent >2% body weight loss. **Post-Exercise**: Replace **150%** of fluid lost—**16-24 fl oz per pound** lost.

**Electrolyte Needs**

Sodium: **0.5-0.7 g/L** in rehydration beverages for exercise >1 hour. Daily losses in hot weather: **3,500-7,000 mg**. Critical for events >1 hour duration.

**Performance Impact of Dehydration**

≥**2% body weight loss** significantly reduces exercise performance in both hot and temperate environments. Affects cardiovascular function, thermoregulation, muscle function, and concentration.

### Creatine Supplementation

**Loading Protocol**: **0.3 g/kg/day (~20g/day)** for 5-7 days, split into 4×5g doses.

**Maintenance**: **3-5 g/day** following loading, or use no-loading approach (3-5g daily achieves same saturation over 3-4 weeks).

**Proven Benefits (ISSN Position)**

Increased high-intensity exercise capacity. Greater gains in lean body mass during training. **5-15% improvement** in maximal strength and power. **5-15% increase** in work performed during multiple sets.

**Safety Profile**

Long-term use (up to **30g/day for 5 years**) is safe and well-tolerated. Over 680 peer-reviewed clinical trials, 12,800+ participants. No clinical adverse events reported. Does NOT cause kidney damage in healthy individuals, dehydration, or cramping.

**Form Recommendation**

Creatine monohydrate is most studied and effective. Most cost-effective. Other forms (HCL, ethyl ester, buffered) show **no superior benefits**.

### Caffeine for Performance

**Optimal Dosing**: **3-6 mg/kg body weight**. Minimal effective dose may be **2 mg/kg**. ≥9 mg/kg provides no additional benefit and increases side effects.

**Timing**: **30-60 minutes** before exercise. Peak serum levels occur 1-2 hours after ingestion.

**Performance Benefits**

Endurance: **2-4% improvement** consistently shown. Small to moderate benefits for muscular endurance, strength, movement velocity. Benefits for sprinting, jumping, throwing.

**Sleep Considerations**

Cutoff recommendation: **6+ hours before bedtime** (highly individual). Half-life of 4-6 hours.

### Caloric Guidelines for Body Composition

**Surplus for Muscle Gain**

**250-500 kcal/day surplus** recommended for lean muscle gain. Larger surpluses increase both muscle AND fat gain. Trained individuals: Smaller surplus (**250-350 kcal**) may minimize fat gain.

**Deficit for Fat Loss**

**500-1000 kcal/day deficit** typical. Maintain energy availability **above 30 kcal/kg FFM/day** to prevent RED-S. Higher protein (**2.3-3.1 g/kg**) critical during deficit.

**Rate Recommendations**

Fat loss: **0.5-1.0 kg/week** for most individuals. Muscle gain (novices): **2-3 lbs per month**. Intermediates: **1-2 lbs per month**. Advanced: **0.5 lb per month**.

## 5. RECOVERY PROTOCOLS

### Sleep Optimization for Athletes

**Duration Recommendations**

General population: 7-9 hours. Athletes: **9-10+ hours** recommended. Young athletes/teens: **9+ hours minimum**.

**Stanford Basketball Sleep Extension Study (Mah et al., 2011)**

Protocol: Players extended sleep from habitual 6-9 hours to minimum 10 hours in bed for 5-7 weeks. Results: Sprint times improved **4.3%**, free throw accuracy **+9%**, 3-point accuracy **+9.2%**, reaction time improved significantly. Average sleep increase: **110.9 minutes** per night.

**Napping Protocols**

Power nap: **20-30 minutes**—enhances alertness without sleep inertia. Full cycle nap: **90 minutes**—completes one sleep cycle including REM. Best timing: Before 3 PM to avoid nighttime sleep interference.

**Sleep Hygiene Practices**

Maintain consistent sleep-wake schedule. Keep bedroom cool (**65-68°F/18-20°C**). Dark sleeping environment. Eliminate screens/blue light 1-2 hours before bed.

### Active Recovery Methods

**Intensity Guidelines**

Heart rate target: **40-60% maximum heart rate**. RPE: 3-4 on 1-10 scale (very light to light effort). Should feel comfortable holding conversation.

**Recommended Modalities**

Light cycling: 15-30 minutes at low intensity. Swimming/pool recovery: Low-impact with hydrostatic pressure benefits. Walking: 20-30 minutes. Yoga/mobility work.

**Duration Recommendations**

Immediately post-exercise: 10-15 minutes cool-down. Active recovery sessions: **20-45 minutes**. Between competition bouts: 10-20 minutes light movement.

### Cold Water Immersion

**Standard Protocol**

Temperature: **10-15°C (50-59°F)**. Duration: **10-15 minutes** optimal. Immersion depth: Mid-sternal to shoulder level.

**Benefits**

Reduces DOMS by up to **30%**. Decreases perceived fatigue and muscle stiffness. Accelerates recovery of countermovement jump performance.

**Critical Consideration: Adaptation Interference**

CWI may blunt long-term training adaptations during hypertrophy phases. Attenuates anabolic signaling pathways. May impair strength and hypertrophy gains.

**When to Use**

APPROPRIATE: Competition periods, tournament play, acute performance recovery. AVOID: Hypertrophy phases, off-season strength development, when long-term adaptation is priority.

**Contrast Water Therapy**

Protocol: Alternating hot (38-40°C) and cold (10-15°C) immersion, **1-2 minutes** each, total **12-20 minutes**. CWT may outperform CWI for power retention and lactate clearance.

### Deload Strategies

**Volume Deload (Most Common)**

Reduction: **30-60%** decrease in weekly volume. Method: Reduce sets per exercise (e.g., from 4 sets to 2 sets). Maintain or slightly reduce intensity.

**Duration and Frequency**

Standard duration: **1 week (5-7 days)**. Frequency: **Every 4-8 weeks** depending on training intensity, training age, and recovery capacity.

**Indicators Deload is Needed**

Stalled or declining performance. Persistent fatigue despite adequate sleep. Elevated resting heart rate. Decreased motivation and mood changes. Increased RPE for normal loads. Lingering soreness beyond normal 24-48 hours.

### HRV Monitoring

**Measurement Protocol**

Measure immediately upon waking. 1-minute stabilization, 1-minute recording. Consistent body position (seated or supine). Before caffeine, food, or physical activity.

**Interpreting Trends**

Use **7-day rolling average (lnRMSSD7-d)**—most reliable. Normal range: **Mean ± 0.5 × standard deviation**. Increasing weekly mean: Positive adaptation. Decreasing weekly mean: Accumulated fatigue.

**Training Modification**

HRV within normal range: Moderate or high-intensity permitted. HRV below normal range: Low-intensity or rest prescribed. Maximum consecutive high-intensity days: **2**. Maximum consecutive rest days: **2**.

### Overreaching and Overtraining

**Functional Overreaching (FOR)**

Short-term performance decrement from intensified training. Recovery: **Days to ~1-2 weeks**. Outcome: Supercompensation after adequate recovery.

**Non-Functional Overreaching (NFOR)**

Excessive training without adequate recovery. Recovery: **Weeks to months**. Symptoms: Prolonged performance decrement, persistent fatigue, mood disturbances, sleep disruption.

**Overtraining Syndrome (OTS)**

Chronic maladaptation of multiple biological systems. Recovery: **Months to years**; may end careers. Prevalence: ~1/3 of competitive athletes experience some form.

**Signs Across Spectrum**

Physical: Unusual muscle soreness, heavy legs, decreased power, increased illness, elevated resting HR. Psychological: Decreased motivation, mood disturbances, sleep problems, difficulty concentrating. Performance: Stalled progress, increased perceived exertion for given workloads.

### Recovery Timeline Between Sessions

**Same Muscle Group**: **48-72 hours** standard recommendation.

**CNS Recovery from Heavy Lifting**

70-80% 1RM: 24-48 hours; minimal CNS stress. 85%+ 1RM: **48-72+ hours** for full recovery. 90-95%+ 1RM: Near full week may be needed.

**Factors Affecting Recovery**

Training variables: Volume, intensity, eccentric loading, exercise novelty. Individual factors: Training age, chronological age, fitness level, sleep quality, nutritional status, life stress.

### Fatigue Management

**Accumulated vs Acute Fatigue**

Acute fatigue: Dissipates within hours to 1-2 days—normal training response. Accumulated/chronic fatigue: Built over multiple sessions/weeks, takes days to weeks to dissipate.

**Fitness-Fatigue Model**: Performance = Fitness - Fatigue. Fatigue dissipates faster than fitness with appropriate rest.

**Acute:Chronic Workload Ratio (ACWR)**

Acute workload: Training load over past 7 days. Chronic workload: Rolling 4-week average. ACWR 0.8-1.3: "Sweet spot"—optimal training zone. ACWR >1.5: **High injury risk** (2-4× increased risk). ACWR <0.8: Potential detraining.

**In-Season Management**

Minimum effective dose: As little as **1 session per week** can maintain gains. Volume reduction: Approximately **1/3 of off-season building volume**. Intensity ≥**80% 1RM** required to maintain strength. Low volume/high intensity superior to high volume/low intensity in-season.

## 6. EXERCISE TECHNIQUE AND CUES

### Squat Coaching Cues

**Setup**

"Get tight on the rack"—create total body tension before unracking. "Big breath, brace"—take deep diaphragmatic breath into belly, create 360-degree expansion. "Wedge under the bar"—drive traps into bar, create shelf.

**Descent**

"Hips back"—initiate by pushing hips posteriorly. "Knees out"—track knees over toes, prevents valgus. "Spread the floor"—external rotation torque at hips, activates glutes.

**Ascent**

"Drive through the floor"—leg press the earth. "Traps up"—drives head/shoulders through bar (preferred over "chest up"). "Squeeze glutes"—complete hip extension at lockout.

### Deadlift Coaching Cues

**Setup**

"Wedge"—use body to wedge between floor and barbell; hips go INTO the bar. "Pull the slack out"—create tension until plates nearly leave floor, hear the "click." "Flex your armpits"—engages lats, keeps bar close. "Point your booty hole at the wall"—keeps hips up, back in extension.

**Pull**

"Push the floor away"—initiates with leg drive. "Hips and shoulders rise together"—prevents hips shooting up. "Bar stays on legs"—maintain contact throughout.

**Lockout**

"Squeeze glutes"—drive hips through. "Stand tall"—complete without hyperextending.

### Bench Press Coaching Cues

**Setup**

"Retract and depress scapulae"—pull shoulder blades back AND down. "Arch your upper back"—thoracic extension, shortens ROM. "Leg drive"—push feet into floor, create stable base.

**Execution**

"Row the bar down"—controlled eccentric with lat engagement. "Bend the bar"—activates lats, controls path. "Elbows at 45-75°"—avoid extreme flare or tuck. "Push yourself into the bench"—maintain upper back tightness.

### Overhead Press Coaching Cues

**Setup**

"Stack your joints"—align wrist over elbow over shoulder. "Elbows forward"—in scapular plane, not out to sides. "Squeeze glutes and abs"—stable pelvis/core.

**Press**

"Head through the window"—as bar clears face, push head between arms. "Press back"—bar goes up AND back, finishing over shoulders.

### Common Technique Faults and Corrections

**Squat: Butt Wink**

Causes: Limited ankle/hip mobility, poor motor control. Corrections: Adjust stance width and toe angle (15-30° toe-out), allow more forward knee travel, ankle mobility drills, goblet squats with slow eccentric stopping before wink.

**Squat: Knee Valgus**

Causes: Weak glute medius, weak adductors, motor control deficit. Corrections: Monster walks with band, light band below knees during squat, "knees out" cue, single-leg RDLs.

**Deadlift: Rounded Back**

Causes: Poor setup, weak extensors, grip failure. Corrections: "Pull chest tall" cue, pause deadlifts at knee, Romanian deadlifts for back strength, block pulls.

**Deadlift: Hips Shooting Up**

Causes: Weak quads, improper setup. Corrections: "Push floor away" cue, "hips and shoulders rise together," start with hips slightly higher.

### Breathing and Bracing

**Valsalva Maneuver Execution**

Take big belly breath (~80% max capacity). Close glottis. Exhale forcefully against closed glottis (NOT closed mouth). Simultaneously brace abs as if taking a punch. Maintain throughout rep. Release at completion.

**360-Degree Expansion**

Breathe into belly—front, sides, AND back. "Fill the canister" / "lower the piston." Creates circumferential intra-abdominal pressure.

**Contraindications**

Heart conditions/cardiovascular disease. History of stroke or aneurysm. Retinal damage. Pregnancy (modified breathing recommended). Extremely high blood pressure.

**Belt Usage**

Provides proprioceptive cue to push against. Can increase intra-abdominal pressure by **30-40%**. Same bracing technique with or without belt. Push INTO belt all around. Typically introduce at **~85%+ 1RM**.

### Grip Variations

**Hook Grip**

Technique: Wrap thumb around bar, wrap index and middle finger OVER thumb. Benefits: Symmetrical position, eliminates bicep tear risk, more secure than double overhand, essential for Olympic lifts. Adaptation period: **2-3 weeks**, expect discomfort initially.

**Mixed Grip**

One hand pronated, one supinated. Drawbacks: Asymmetrical stress, bicep tear risk on supinated arm. Recommendation: Alternate which hand is supinated, or switch to hook grip.

### Stance Width Guidelines

**Squat Stance Factors**

Individual factors: Hip socket depth/orientation, femur length, ankle mobility. Narrow stance (hip width): More quad dominant, requires good ankle mobility. Medium stance (shoulder width): Balanced, most common starting point. Wide stance (outside shoulder width): More hip/adductor emphasis, shorter ROM.

Foot angle: Most lifters **15-30° toe-out**. Knees should track over toes.

**Deadlift Stance Selection**

Conventional: Feet hip-width, toes forward or slightly out (14 ± 6°). Greater posterior chain emphasis, more lower back stress. Better for shorter torsos, strong posterior chain.

Sumo: Feet wide (70 ± 11 cm), toes significantly out (42 ± 8°). More upright torso, more quad/adductor emphasis, less spinal loading, **~19% shorter bar travel**. Better for longer torsos, those with back issues.

Hip structure is PRIMARY determinant—experiment with both.

### Exercise Variations

**Squat Variations**

High bar: On upper traps, more upright, quad emphasis, Olympic lift carryover. Low bar: On rear deltoids, more forward lean, posterior chain emphasis, **10-15% more weight** typically. Safety bar: Shoulder-friendly, greater gluteus maximus activation. Box squat: Teaches depth, develops starting strength. Goblet squat: Ideal learning tool, self-correcting.

**Deadlift Variations**

Romanian deadlift: Hamstring/glute emphasis, teaches hip hinge. Trap bar: More upright torso, reduced shear stress, excellent for beginners/athletes. Deficit: Increased ROM, strengthens position off floor. Block/rack pulls: Overload lockout, address sticking points.

**Pressing Variations**

Incline (15-45°): Upper chest emphasis, 30° often cited as optimal. Close grip: Triceps emphasis, shoulder-friendly. Floor press: Limited ROM, lockout/triceps focus, shoulder-friendly. Push press: Power development from leg drive.

**Row Variations**

Pendlay row: Torso parallel, explosive, full ROM from dead stop. Yates row: 45-70° torso, underhand grip, lower lat/bicep emphasis. Chest-supported: Eliminates lower back involvement, isolates upper back.

### Olympic Lift Progressions

**Clean Progression (Catalyst Athletics/Greg Everett)**

Muscle clean → Front squat → Hang power clean → Power clean → Hang clean → Clean from floor.

**Snatch Progression**

Pressing snatch balance → Muscle snatch → Overhead squat → Hang power snatch → Power snatch → Hang snatch → Snatch from floor.

**Jerk Progression**

Press → Push press → Jerk balance → Power jerk → Split jerk.

**Corrective Approach (Greg Everett)**

Position (correct key positions) → Balance (maintain over midfoot) → Motion (correct patterns) → Speed (add only after positions/motion correct) → Loading (last step).

## 7. SPECIAL POPULATIONS

### Training During Pregnancy

**ACOG Guidelines (Committee Opinion 804, 2020)**

Exercise is safe and desirable during uncomplicated pregnancies. Recommended: **150 minutes/week** of moderate-intensity aerobic activity. Benefits: Reduces risk of gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, cesarean birth.

**Safe Exercises**

Walking, swimming, stationary cycling, modified strength training, prenatal yoga (not hot yoga). Avoid: Contact sports, high fall-risk activities, scuba diving, hot yoga (**95-104°F** environments), exercise at altitudes **>6,000 feet**.

**Intensity Guidelines**

"Talk test": Should speak in short sentences. RPE: **12-14** on Borg scale (somewhat hard). Avoid exercising to exhaustion.

**Warning Signs to Stop**

Vaginal bleeding, dizziness, chest pain, regular painful contractions, shortness of breath BEFORE starting, fluid leaking, calf pain/swelling, decreased fetal movement.

**Pelvic Floor Considerations**

Focus on anti-rotation, anti-extension core exercises. Watch for "coning" at linea alba—modify or eliminate exercises causing this.

### Postpartum Return to Training

**Timeline**

General activity: Days after delivery, as tolerated. Medical clearance: Typically **6 weeks** (vaginal), **8-12 weeks** post-C-section. Pelvic floor recovery: **4-6 months** for maximum recovery.

**Pelvic Floor Rehabilitation First**

Pelvic floor training reduces urinary incontinence odds by **37%**, pelvic organ prolapse by **56%**. First-line intervention for pelvic floor disorders.

**Diastasis Recti Management**

60% of women have diastasis at 6 weeks postpartum. Gap typically closes in **4-8 weeks**. Exercises: Diaphragmatic breathing, pelvic tilts, heel slides, dead bugs. Avoid: Crunches, sit-ups, planks, push-ups until resolved.

**Return to Impact**

Avoid running/jumping until: No leaking with cough/sneeze, no pelvic pressure. Test: Can hop/jump without symptoms. Recommended: **12+ weeks** postpartum for running.

**When to See Pelvic Floor PT**

Persistent incontinence, pelvic pain, pelvic pressure/heaviness, diastasis that doesn't improve, before returning to high-impact exercise.

### Training with Diabetes

**Type 1 Pre-Exercise Blood Glucose Targets**

Target range: **90-250 mg/dL**. <100 mg/dL: Consume 15-20g carbohydrate before exercise. Check glucose 15-30 minutes before, every 30-60 minutes during.

**Hypoglycemia Prevention**

Effects can last **24-48 hours** post-exercise. For 30-60 min moderate activity: **10-15g carbs** (low insulin). With bolus insulin on board: **30-60g carbs/hour** may be needed. Keep fast-acting glucose available.

**Exercise Type Effects**

Aerobic: Typically decreases blood glucose. Resistance/high-intensity: May increase blood glucose (especially fasted). Resistance before aerobic: Helps maintain blood glucose.

**Type 2 Guidelines (ACSM/ADA)**

Minimum **150 min/week** moderate intensity. Resistance training **2-3 days/week**. No more than 2 consecutive days without exercise. Post-meal walking (15 min): Improves glycemic control. High-intensity resistance training more effective than low-to-moderate.

### Training with Hypertension

**ACSM Guidelines**

Frequency: **5-7 days/week** aerobic, **2-3 days/week** resistance. Intensity: Moderate (**40-59% VO2R** or HRR). Duration: At least **150 minutes/week**.

**Breathing Guidelines**

Avoid excessive Valsalva maneuver. Continuous breathing during resistance exercises. Exhale on exertion. Use RPE if on medications affecting heart rate.

**Contraindications**

Resting BP **>180/110 mmHg**: No exercise until controlled. Stop for: Chest pain, unusual shortness of breath, dizziness, irregular heartbeat.

### Autoimmune Conditions

**General Principles**

Physical activity is safe in most autoimmune diseases. Exercise produces anti-inflammatory effects (reduces CRP, IL-6, TNF-α). Moderate intensity appears safe and beneficial.

**Rheumatoid Arthritis**

Aerobic + strength training recommended as routine. Regular exercisers show milder disease course. Protect inflamed joints during flares.

**Multiple Sclerosis**

Exercise decreases fatigue significantly. Swimming/water aerobics beneficial. Heat sensitivity: Use cooling strategies.

**Flare Management**

Reduce intensity and duration during flares. Resume gradually post-flare. Focus on gentle movement to maintain mobility.

### Training in Heat

**Heat Acclimatization (10-14 Days)**

Start with shorter, less intense sessions. Progress: Increase duration first, then intensity. Goal: 90 minutes daily in target heat conditions.

**Hydration Strategies**

Pre-hydrate: **16-24 oz** before exercise. During: **200-300 ml every 15 minutes**; up to 1.5 L/hour for intense exercise. Post: **16-24 oz per pound** lost.

**Warning Signs**

Heat cramps, heat syncope, heat exhaustion (heavy sweating, weakness, nausea), heat stroke (**EMERGENCY**—high temp, confusion, no sweating).

### Training in Cold

**Extended Warm-Up**

Warm up indoors before going outside. Longer warm-up period: **10-15+ minutes**. Cold muscles more susceptible to strain.

**Clothing Layers**

Base: Moisture-wicking (NOT cotton). Insulation: Fleece, wool, synthetic. Outer: Wind and water resistant. Critical: Hat, gloves, neck protection.

**Cold-Related Risks**

Frostbite, frostnip, hypothermia (core temp **<95°F**). Signs: Confusion, slurred speech, loss of coordination, shivering.

### Altitude Training

**Live High-Train Low Concept**

Living altitude: **2,000-3,000 m** (6,500-10,000 feet). Training altitude: Sea level to 1,200 m.

**Acclimatization Timeline**

EPO increase: Within 48 hours. Significant adaptations: **3-4 weeks minimum**. Minimum effective dose: **>12 hours/day** at altitude for 3+ weeks. Hemoglobin mass increases **~3.4%** after 2 weeks at >2,100 m.

**Performance Decrements**

VO2max reduced approximately **1% per 100m above 1,500m**. Reduce training intensity first **7-10 days**. Expect ~10-15% reduction in aerobic capacity initially.

## 8. WARM-UP PROTOCOLS

### RAMP Protocol

**Overview (Dr. Ian Jeffreys, 2006)**

Standard system recommended by UKSCA and NSCA. Duration: **10-20 minutes**. Intensity: **40-60% maximal oxygen uptake**.

**RAISE Phase (5 minutes)**

Goal: Increase heart rate, core temperature, blood flow, muscle elasticity. Activities: Light jogging, side shuffles, jump rope, arm circles. Outcome: Onset of sweating indicates adequate temperature rise.

**ACTIVATE Phase**

Goal: Engage key muscles for upcoming session. Activities: Glute bridges for hip work, band pull-aparts for pressing/pulling, dead bugs for core, mini-band walks for hip stability.

**MOBILIZE Phase**

Goal: Enhance joint-specific range of motion. Activities: Hip circles and leg swings, thoracic rotations, ankle rockers, dynamic lunges with rotation.

**POTENTIATE Phase**

Goal: Movement-specific preparation, CNS priming. Activities: Warm-up sets progressing to working weight, jumps/bounds/sprints, sport-specific patterns.

### Sport-Specific Warm-Ups

**FIFA 11+ Protocol (Team Sports)**

20-minute complete warm-up. Reduces injuries by **30-50%**. Three parts: Running/mobility (8 min), strength/conditioning (3 difficulty levels), high-speed running and agility. Frequency: Minimum **2-3×/week**.

**Strength Training Warm-Up Structure**

General warm-up (5 min): Rowing, cycling, jogging. Dynamic stretching: Focus on working joints. Activation: Target weak links. Movement-specific progression: Empty bar → 40% → 60% → 80% → Working sets.

### Activation Exercises

**Glute Activation**

Purpose: Address gluteal amnesia, improve hip stability. Exercises: Banded lateral walks, clamshells, glute bridges, fire hydrants. Sets/Reps: **2 × 10-15 each side**.

**Core Activation**

Purpose: Establish anterior core stability. Exercises: Dead bugs, bird dogs, Pallof press, plank variations. Sets/Reps: **2 × 8-12 reps** or **20-30 second holds**.

**Shoulder Activation**

Purpose: Rotator cuff engagement, scapular stability. Exercises: Band pull-aparts, YTWs, external rotations, face pulls. Sets/Reps: **2 × 10-15 reps**.

### CNS Preparation for Heavy Lifting

**Neural Priming**

Goal: Maximize motor unit recruitment. Timing: After general warm-up, before main work sets. Methods: Ballistic movements (box jumps 3-5 reps, medicine ball throws), progressive loading.

**Warm-Up Set Progressions**

Example for 315 lb working weight: Empty bar (8-10 reps) → 135 lb (5 reps) → 185 lb (3 reps) → 225 lb (2 reps) → 275 lb (1 rep) → Working sets. Rest: 1-2 min between warm-up sets, **3-5 min** before work sets.

**Heavy Holds**

Supramaximal holds: **100-120%** of working weight. Duration: **5-10 seconds**. Purpose: Familiarize nervous system with heavy load. Rest: **2-3 minutes** before main work.

### Potentiation Strategies (PAP)

**Mechanisms**

Phosphorylation of myosin regulatory light chains. Improved motor neuron excitability. Enhanced calcium sensitivity.

**Application**

Conditioning exercise: Heavy load (**>80% 1RM**), low reps (1-5). Rest interval: **3-12 minutes** (individual variation). Performance exercise: Explosive/sport-specific movement.

**Rest Interval Guidelines**

Research: **3-12 minutes** most effective. Stronger athletes may need shorter rest. Less trained need longer recovery. Potentiation peak: **3-7 minutes** after conditioning.

**Sample PAP Protocols**

Lower body: 3 × 3 back squat at 85% → 5 min rest → Vertical jumps. Sprint priming: Heavy sled push → 5 min rest → Sprint.

## 9. FATIGUE INDICATORS AND MONITORING

### Subjective Measures

**Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE)**

Borg Scale (6-20) or Modified Scale (0-10). Session RPE: RPE × session duration (minutes). Increased RPE for given workload = early overreaching sign.

**Wellness Questionnaires**

Sleep quality (1-5 scale), general fatigue, muscle soreness, stress level, readiness to train.

**Validated Tools**

REST-Q-Sport: Recovery-Stress Questionnaire (comprehensive). POMS: Profile of Mood States. Hooper Index: Sleep, stress, fatigue, muscle soreness.

### Objective Measures

**Bar Speed/Velocity**

Mean velocity decline indicates fatigue. First-rep velocity monitoring for daily readiness.

**Countermovement Jump**

Sensitive to neuromuscular fatigue. Compromised up to **24+ hours** post intense training.

**Grip Strength**

Simple measure of neuromuscular readiness. Decreased grip = potential CNS fatigue.

**Heart Rate Markers**

Resting heart rate (elevated = potential fatigue). Heart rate recovery post-exercise. Heart rate at submaximal fixed workload.

### In-Season Training Load Management

**Maintenance Principles**

Volume: **~1/3 of building phase**. Intensity: Maintain **≥80% 1RM** to preserve strength. Frequency: **2 strength sessions/week** typical. 48-hour rule: Allow 48+ hours between intense training and competition.

**Priority Hierarchy**

1. Sport-specific practice and skill development
2. Competition performance
3. Strength maintenance training
4. General conditioning
