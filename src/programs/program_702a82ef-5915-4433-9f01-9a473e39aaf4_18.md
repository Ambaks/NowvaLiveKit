# Explosive Elevation: 8-Week Barbell Power Block for Basketball

**Created for:** Baka
**Program ID:** 18
**Duration:** 8 weeks
**Created:** 2025-10-26 00:02
**VBT Enabled:** Yes

## Description

An 8-week barbell-only power block designed for intermediate basketball players who need to increase vertical jump, first-step explosiveness, and full-body rate of force development. This block emphasizes Olympic lifts, explosive barbell variations, and velocity-based autoregulation using a VBT device. The first 4 weeks (this batch) build power and technical consistency, then include a planned deload to consolidate gains.

## VBT Setup

VBT is enabled for primary Olympic and speed/power lifts in this program. Device placement: bar-mounted or barbell sensor. Key velocity thresholds used: Clean/Snatch (velocity_threshold = 1.0 m/s, velocity_min = 0.95 m/s); Jerk (velocity_threshold = 1.2 m/s, velocity_min = 1.1 m/s); Speed Squat (velocity_threshold = 0.85 m/s, velocity_min = 0.75 m/s); Speed Bench (velocity_threshold = 0.6 m/s, velocity_min = 0.5 m/s); Speed Deadlift (velocity_threshold = 0.75 m/s, velocity_min = 0.65 m/s). Autoregulation rules: if avg velocity >= threshold, increase load 2.5-5% next session for that movement; if avg velocity < velocity_min, reduce load 5-10% or end set early. Set termination: "Stop set when velocity drops >10% from the first rep." Do NOT use VBT for isolation accessory sets. Record average velocity per set and rep to track progress.

## Deload Schedule

Deload every 4th week (Week 4, Week 8): reduce intensity to 60-70% of 1RM and reduce total weekly volume by 40-50%. Focus on technique and recovery during deload.
