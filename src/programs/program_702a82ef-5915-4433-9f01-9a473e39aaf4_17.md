# 3x/Week Barbell Strength Builder — Test Block

**Created for:** Baka
**Program ID:** 17
**Duration:** 12 weeks
**Created:** 2025-10-25 20:39

## Description

4-week intermediate strength block (barbell-only) designed to build raw strength and work capacity for an intermediate lifter. Focuses on heavy compound lifts (squat, bench, deadlift, presses) with barbell accessory work. Intended for a 30M intermediate trainee training 3 days/week for ~60 minutes per session. This is a test program — conservative progress across the block with a planned deload in Week 4.

## Deload Schedule

Deload on Week 4: reduce intensity to 60-70% 1RM and reduce total sets by ~40-50% (fewer accessory sets; main lifts reduced sets). Then resume new block or repeat with adjusted loads.
