# Court Explosive: 8-Week Barbell Power Block for Basketball

**Program ID:** 19
**Duration:** 8 weeks
**Created:** 2025-10-26 16:40

## Description

An 8-week, barbell-only power development program designed for an advanced basketball athlete seeking greater on-court explosiveness. Emphasis: Olympic derivatives (clean/snatch/jerk), speed-strength (speed squats/bench/deadlift), and sport-specific strength transfer. Each session includes a dedicated 30-minute ankle + whole-body mobility block to address a stiff left ankle and improve movement quality. VBT is integrated for Olympic and speed work to autoregulate load and maximize rate of force development.

- **2. Power Clean (from hang/full as preferred) (VBT):** Target: 1.00 m/s, stop if below 0.95 m/s
- **3. Front Squat:** Front squat builds the clean catch strength; use straps or cross-arm grip as needed for comfort.
- **4. Speed Squat (explosive concentric, no or minimal jump):** Explosive concentric focus; keep eccentric controlled and protect ankle on descent.
- **4. Speed Squat (explosive concentric, no or minimal jump) (VBT):** Target: 0.85 m/s, stop if below 0.75 m/s
